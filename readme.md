### PM Tagger
pm (Policy Manager) tagger is a lightweight deployment that works with the new management service. It labels a single Gateway pod to allow for a stable Policy Manager connection when running multiple gateways.

This is an optional component in the [Gateway Helm Chart](https://github.com/CAAPIM/apim-charts/tree/stable/charts/gateway)
